# Exploring-the-Integration-of-A9G-and-ESP32-for-Smart-Emergency-Response-System
A smart emergency tracker using ESP32 and A9G board
The project aims to develop an efficient and robust solution by leveraging the capabilities of the A9G Board and the ESP32 microcontroller. The primary focus of this project is to enhance user accessibility and operational effectiveness in emergency situations. To achieve this, we integrate the A9G Board for telecommunication purposes and the ESP32 for handling computational tasks.
One of the standout features of our system is the implementation of Geofencing, which allows for the definition of virtual boundaries. When a device crosses these predefined boundaries, automatic alerts are triggered, ensuring timely responses.
Additionally, we integrate fall detection capabilities using Arduino, which can identify sudden falls and immediately alert emergency contacts.
